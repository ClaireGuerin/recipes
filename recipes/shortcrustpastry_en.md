# Shortcrust pastry
- 250g flour
- 70g sugar
- 1 egg
- 125g butter
- Water 
- 1 pinch of salt

Separate the yolk from the egg’s white. Set the white on the side, you can keep them for other purposes. In a bowl, beat together yolk, sugar (70g) and a bit of water. 

Cut the butter (125g) in cubes, and mix it with flour (250g) and salt (1 pinch), until it takes a sandy texture. Build a "volcano" with that mixture, and pour the mix of sugar and yolk in the center. Knead everything together, and form a ball. 

Let it rest in a fresh place for about 1 hour (or less if you don’t have time, but it’s always better when you wait).
Butter a pie plate and dust it with flour. Flatten and spread the pastry in it. After making holes in the pastry with a fork, put the plate in the oven (150°C) for about 10 mins in order for the pastry to glaze.
