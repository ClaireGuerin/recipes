# Lemon Pie Meringue

## Shortcrust pastry
- 250g flour
- 70g sugar
- 1 egg
- 125g butter
- Water 
- 1 pinch of salt

Separate the yolk from the egg’s white. Set the white on the side, it will be used later for the meringue. In a bowl, beat together yolk, sugar (70g) and a bit of water. 

Cut the butter (125g) in cubes, and mix it with flour (250g) and salt (1 pinch), until it takes a sandy texture. Build a "volcano" with that mixture, and pour the mix of sugar and yolk in the center. Knead everything together, and form a ball. 

Let it rest in a fresh place for about 1 hour (or less if you don’t have time, but it’s always better when you wait).
Butter a pie plate and dust it with flour. Flatten and spread the pastry in it. After making holes in the pastry with a fork, put the plate in the oven (150°C) for about 10 mins in order for the pastry to glaze.

## Lemon cream
- 2 lemons and 1 lime (or 2, if they’re small)
- 100g sugar
- Water
- Flour (keep the whole pack at hand, you’ll need to adjust the amount to the texture of the cream) 
- 3 eggs

Beat 1 whole egg and 2 yolks together. Set the remaining 2 egg whites aside with the previous one for the meringue. 
In a pan, first grate the 2 lemons, then squeeze them and the lime. Don’t hesitate to keep the pulp with the juice and zest as well, but be careful to discard the seeds. Add the sugar (100g) and place the pan on the stove. Turn the heat on to warm the mix up while stirring constantly and energically. Slowly add the flour and the water. The exact amount of both water and flour is up to you. Add first the flour, little by little, and make sure it incorporates well with the juice. Adjust with water if it becomes too thick. When you are satisfied with the cream’s texture, and as soon as the colour of the mixture is turning from bright yellow to darker, add the eggs and keep on stirring to avoid the eggs to cook as an omelet! Once the mixture is hard enough, pull the pan out of the fire.

> N.B.: when cooking, the temperature must be high, but it must never boil! You have to keep an eye on it during the whole process.

Spread the lemon cream on the pastry in the pie plate.

## Meringue
- 2 / 3 egg whites (depends if you’ve done the pastry yourself)
- 100g sugar

Whisk the 3 egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Then mix the sugar (100g) in softly in order not to break the whites. Use a scraper if you can.

Spread the meringue on the lemon cream in the pie plate, in order to cover entirely the cream. Put the plate in the oven (150°C) for about 20 mins. You’ll know it’s ready when the meringue will glaze, or turn into a pinkish colouration.
